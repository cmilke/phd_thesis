% Draft stages:
% outline - Basic layout and section design
% draft alpha - Information for all sections in a vaguely structured format
% draft beta - All sections revised into actual sentences
% draft 0 - Chapter has all information with proper sentence structure and section transitions, along with needed figures
% draft # - Anything after revising the #th series of comments from Steve
% draft omega # - Anything after revising the #th series of comments from the committee/higher bureaucracy

%NOTE: according to Steve, you can (and SHOULD) use "I" in the theory chapter. Indeed, use "I" as well literally anywhere I specifically was responsible for something. Do NOT use royal "we". Only use "we" in the context of what "we" the HDBS 4b or dihiggs group have done as a group, and only if you have explicitly defined who "we" are.
