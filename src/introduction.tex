\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

The basic structure of every lab report you've ever done is: 
    introduction,
    theory,
    experimental setup,
    procedure,
    results,
    conclusion.

This thesis is essentially following that same format:
    Introduction,
    Standard Model (theory),
    LHC and ATLAS (experimental setup)
    procedure (search)
    results (...)
    conclusion
