%The basic structure of every lab report you've ever done is:

%This thesis is essentially following that same format:

The Higgs Boson was proposed as a fundamental particle in 1964,
    and has been a driving factor in particle physics research ever since.
Though it was jointly discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations,
    there are still a number of properties of the Higgs which have yet to be measured.
Chief among these are two of the Higgs' self-coupling constants, \kl and \kvv,
    which determine how strongly the Higgs interacts with both itself and with vector bosons.
This analysis performs a search for the rare,
    as-yet unseen diHiggs interaction in order to set tighter constraints on these coupling values.
The search utilizes the Vector Boson Fusion production mechanism of the diHiggs process,
    identifying the process in the 4b final state.
This is performed using 126 $\textit{fb}^{-1}$ of data from Run 2 of ATLAS.

This thesis will begin by first explaining the importance of the Higgs Boson to the field of particle physics,
    as well as the relevance of the aforementioned \kl and \kvv coupling constants.
I will then describe the physical effects of these constants,
    and how those effects can be exploited in order to make measurements of them.
These topics comprise Chapter \ref{chapter:theory}.
Following from the theoretical discussion, I will discus the experimental equipment and setup used to perform the  measurments.
The experimental setup is discussed across three chapters.
Chapter \ref{chapter:lhc} discusses the Large Hadron Collider, the machine which generates the conditions necessary to produce diHiggs process.
Actual observation of the process once generated is carried out by the ATLAS particle detector array and its Trigger system,
    described in Chapters \ref{chapter:atlas} and \ref{chapter:trigger}.
The reconstruction process, described in Chapter \ref{chapter:reconstruction},
    entails how data observed by ATLAS is analyzed in order to determine which physics processes occured during the myriad observed interactions.
Background processes are removed from the data set using a selection procedure explained in Chapter \ref{chapter:selection},
    and the contribution of the background events which remain is estimated using data-driven technique cataloged in Chapter \ref{chapter:background}. 
The background estimation process makes use of a neural network reweighting procedure, which I personally configured and ran the training for.
My primary contribution to the analysis however, comes in the form of the signal model that constitutes the hypothesis for the behaviour of the Higgs Boson.
The signal model makes use of a Monte-Carlo sample combination technique, which I developed and optimized in the context of the \vbfproc process.
This is elaborated upon in Chapter \ref{chapter:signal}.
Finally, in Chapter \ref{chapter:results}, this hypothesis alongside the background estimate are compared against the data observed from ATLAS,
    in order to make constraints on the diHiggs self-coupling constants.
