\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

The basic structure of every lab report you've ever done is: 
    introduction,
    theory,
    experimental setup,
    procedure,
    results,
    conclusion.

This thesis is essentially following that same format:
    Introduction,
    Standard Model... and Signal modelling? (theory),
    LHC and ATLAS and Trigger (experimental setup)
    Reconstruction, Selection, Background Estimation (procedure)
    results (...)
    conclusion
