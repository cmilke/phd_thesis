\chapter{Signal Modeling}

How do we produce a signal hypothesis that we can test?
Mostly just a bunch of software.

\section{Monte-Carlo Simulation}

    Need to cover MadGraph, Pythia, and Geant4.

\section{Signal Combination}

    Also get to talk about my work! Woohoo!

\section{Solidarity}
    
    Should this go here?
