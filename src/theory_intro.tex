\section{Introduction}

    The Higgs Boson sits as the crown jewel of a grand overarching theory of the behaviour of the universe,
        known as the Standard Model of Particle Physics.
    While its recent discovery has shed light on many of its key properties,
        there are still many details of its nature that are as yet uncomfirmed.
    In this chapter, I want to explain what these properties are and how they can be further studied.
    Moreover, I want to justify why the Higgs is so important as to be worth studying in the first place.
    And to understand the importance of the Higgs Boson, one must understand the structure of the Standard Model itself.

    The structure of the following sections will begin with a discussion of the purpose and fundamental structure of the Standard Model.
    I will follow this with an introduction to the mathematical formalism the Standard Model is based around,
        involving Group Theory, the calculus of variations, and symmetry.
    Here I will introduce the reason for the original postulation of the Higgs, what it is, how it works, and how it fits into the Standard Model.
    Finally, I will motivate further study into the Higgs and provide a technique to perform this study.

\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
    
    At its core, the Standard Model of Particle Physics is a description of the behaviour and interaction of matter.
    First and foremost then, I want to discuss what this matter actually is.
    All matter can be described as a specific type of elementary particle called a fermion,
        defined by the fact that it contains no discernable substructure and possesses an intrinsic spin of 1/2.
    These particles all have different masses, and are able to interact with each other through three ``fundamental interactions''.
    The three fundamental interactions (more commonly called ``Fundamental Forces'') are known as
        the Electromagnetic, Weak, and Strong interactions (gravity is entirely absent in the Standard Model).
    All the interactions have an associated ``charge'' which can be ascribed to different particles,
        and which govern how strongly that particle can interact with similarly charged particles.
    The various fermions are distinct largely because of the charges they carry.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{theory/Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles}
        \caption{I'm probably going to need to find something else since this came from wikipedia. I just wanted a placeholder}
        \label{fig:sm_particles}
    \end{figure}
        

    There are twelve distinct elementary fermions (see Figure \ref{fig:sm_particles}),
        which are split evenly into two subgroups, called quarks and leptons.
    Quarks have a charge of 1 with the Strong interaction,
        while leptons have a charge of 0 (and thus cannot interact via the Strong Interaction at all).
    Both classes of particles, quarks and leptons, are divided into three ``generations'' of progressively heavier particles.
    Each generation thus consists of two quarks and two leptons.
    These pairs, called ``doublets'', behave the same across all generations.
    Among the quarks, every generation contains a doublet of an up-type quark (Up, Charm, Top) with electromagnetic charge of 2/3,
        and a down-type quark (Down, Strange, Bottom) with EM charge of -1/3.
    For leptons, each doublet consists of a particle with EM charge of -1, and a neutrino with EM charge of 0.

    In addition to the fermions, there is also an entirely seperate class of particles, called gauge bosons,
        which play a fundamental role in the aforementioned interactions.
    However, the nature of these particles will be discussed later.
    Now, with the enumeration of the various particles complete, it is time to begin the discussion of the Standard Model itself,
        which will serve to explain how these fermions interact with each other.



\section{Composition of Matter: Fields and Dirac Spinors}

    %Fields are a thing.
    The description of matter is governed by the formalism of Quantum Field Theory, which describes particles as pertubations of an overall particle \textit{field}.
    %They're kinda like quantum waves, but not.
    A particle field $\varphi$, describes every particle of the same type at once,
        and particle states $\ket{\varphi}$ correspond to the number of that kind of particle that exists at a given moment.
    The equation of motion used to describe a field varies depending on the properties of the field.
    For a scalar (spinless) field, \phi, the equation of motion is the Klein-Gordon Equation
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
        p^2 \phi = m^2 \phi
        \\(p^2 - m^2) \phi = 0
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    Recalling the covariant, natural units, quantum mechanical definition of momentum as $p^u = i\partial^u$,
        this can also be written as
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
        (p^2 - m^2) \phi = 0 \rightarrow (\partial^\mu \partial_\mu + m^2) \phi = 0
    \end{split} \end{equation}

    The Klein-Gordan Equation will be used later when describing the Higgs Field,
        but for now the more important equation is that used for fermions, $\psi$,
        called the Dirac Equation
    \begin{equation}
        (\gamma^\mu p_\mu - m) \psi = 0
        (i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu  - m) \psi = 0
    \end{equation}

    The Dirac Equation seeks to make the equation of motion first order (i.e.\ only one derivative),
        as this permits a representation of a spinor field.
    Doing this comes with a cost however, as momentum $p_\mu$ is a four-vector, but mass is a scalar.
    The resolution to this problem is a set of four, 4x4 matrices, $\gamma^\mu$, called the gamma matrices.


    %Fields don't describe a single particle, but all particles of the same type at once.
    %Field states are just a count of how many of that particles exist at a given time.
    %Scalar particles are described by Klein Gordon Equation.
    %Spin 1/2 particles are described by dirac equation.
    %It's first order in p, but this requires the gamma matrices.
    %Matrices take many forms, but one of the most revealing is the Weyl, or Chiral, form.
    %Do some math to show fields in chiral form, to show Chirality.


    %It takes from quantum mechanics the uncertainty principle, and from relativity the mass/energy equivalence 
    %It takes from quantum mechanics the wave-like description of position and momentum, along with the uncertainty principle.
    %From special relativity it incorporates the equivalence of space and time, the constance of the speed of light,
    %    and the exchange between mass and energy.
    %Combining the energy/time uncertainty principle with mass/energy equivalence in particular
    %    has the outcome that the number of particles for a given system need not remain constant.
    %To account for this, particles are not described as waves as with the Schrodinger Equation, but rather as ``fields''.
    %A fermion field, $\psi$, does not describe a single particle, but rather all possible fermion for the same kind of particle.
    %For instance, there is a seperate fermion field to describe electrons, up-quarks, and so forth.

\section{Generating Motion: Group Theory and Transformations}

    The Dirac Equation provides a description of matter.
    The next key piece of the Standard Model is a description of motion itself.
    For this, I will need to introduce Group Theory.

    A function can be altered using a \textit{transformation operator}.
    A simple example of this would be a function $x(t)$, 
        which (assuming constant velocity) can be transformed into a time $\Delta t$ in the future as
    \begin{equation}
    x(t) \rightarrow x'(t) = x(t) + v \Delta t
    \end{equation}
    Noting that $v$ is just $\frac{d}{dt} x(t)$, this can be rewritten as
    \begin{equation}
    x(t) \rightarrow x'(t) = x(t) + \Delta t \frac{d}{dt} x(t) = \left(1+\Delta t \frac{d}{dt}\right) x(t)
    \end{equation}

    This term $\left(1+\Delta t \frac{d}{dt}\right)$ is the classical time-translation operator.
    Notice the assumption of \textit{constant velocity} though.
    If velocity were not constant, this operator would be invalid, except for in the specific case in which $\Delta t$ is infinitesimal.
    \begin{equation}
    x(t) \rightarrow x'(t) = \lim_{\delta t \to 0} \left(1+\delta t \frac{d}{dt}\right) x(t)
    \end{equation}

    To produce a more general finite operator however, I can just apply the infinitesimal operator an infinite number of times
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
    x(t) \rightarrow x'(t) &= \lim_{\delta t \to 0} \left(1+\delta t \frac{d}{dt}\right)\left(1+\delta t \frac{d}{dt}\right)\left(1+\delta t \frac{d}{dt}\right)...\ x(t)
    \\x(t) \rightarrow x'(t) &= \lim_{N \to \infty} \lim_{\delta t \to 0} \left(1+\delta t \frac{d}{dt}\right)^N x(t)
    \\x(t) \rightarrow x'(t) &= e^{\Delta t \frac{d}{dt}} x(t)
    \end{split} \end{equation}

    Where $\Delta t$ is again a finite time transformation,
        and I have compressed the infinite product of terms using the power series expansion of the exponential function.
    In order to use this classical operator in quantum field theory, it must have a complex factor `$i$' associated with it
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
    x(t) \rightarrow x'(t) = e^{i\Delta t \frac{d}{dt}} x(t)
    \end{split} \end{equation}



     

    %A ``group'' is a set of elements which can be ``multiplied'' according to some rule,
    %    and which satisfies the four conditions of:
    %        \begin{itemize}
    %            \item Closure - the product of any two elements of the group are still in that group;
    %            \item Associativity - $(a \times b)\times c = a\times(b \times c)$;
    %            \item Identity - there is some element in the group $I$ for which $I \times a=a$;
    %            \item and Inversion - every element $a$ has an inverse $a^{-1}$ such that if $b \times a = c$ then $c \times a^{-1} = b$.
    %        \end{itemize}

    %If the group operation is commutative ($ab=ba$) then the group is ``Abelian''; if not, it is ``non-Abelian''.

\section{Restricting Motion: The Lagrangian and Symmetry}
    
    The Dirac Equation describes the equation of motion of a single field.
    I need a way to describe the collective motion and interactions of many fields at once.
    Enter the Lagrangian.

    

    %Explain how motion is described by a lagrangian of fields. 
    %Minization of Action.
    %Equations of motion derived from Euler-Lagrange Equations.
    %The lagrangian takes the form it does in order to satisfy poincare symmetry.

    %Discuss Noether's Theorem; refer to Halzen pg 314 (djvu=331) or, maybe better, Sredneki pg 144).
    %    ... Wait, do I even need to mention noether's theorem?
    %    I don't think it's actually a factor in producing the higgs... which makes me slightly sad :-(

    %I also should maybe end this with a discussion of how forces aren't really a thing
    %    and particles in field theory exchange momentum by merely bumping into other particles.
    %Maybe, *maybe**** (maybe not) give a toy example lagrangian showing a particle which can interact with itself via a three-point vertex or something.
    %Note the basic symmetries that the basic lagrangian must satisfy (hence group theory going first)
    %
    %Should I also discuss renormalizability? (Peskin pg 80/101djvu)
    %Basically, all lagrangians must be renormalizable.
    %Renormalizability just means that the lagrangian doesn't explode from the unconstrained nature of virtual particles.
    %So infinite-mass virtual particles should not break a renormalizeable lagrangian.
    \cite{Halzen_book}


\section{Transferring Motion: Gauge Symmetry}
    Gauge Transformations are ones where the transformation is imposed differently at each point in spacetime.
    Trying to impose a constraint on the Lagrangian that it be symmetric under gauge transformations would surely cause all manner of complications.
    Obviously, this is exactly what nature seems to have chosen to do.

    Gauge symmetries; U1, SU(N).
    The effects of imposing gauge symmetries on the Lagrangian, and the advent of the gauge bosons and their forces.
    how do gauge bosons come out from symmetries.

    U(1) is phase transforms

    SU(2) is based on 2x2 pauli matrices and thus requires pairing generations of particles together;
        so up and down-type quarks are paired together and charged leptons with neutrinos.
    It treats left handed fields as these doublet pairs,
        but works in "singlet representation" (which means it basically is just gone) for right-handed fields

    SU(3) is based on a 3x3 structure constant, and thus acts on all three "generations" of quarks as one 3x1 vector.
    It is a singlet (read, it literally doesn't matter) for leptons.
