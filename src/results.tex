\chapter{Results}

Need to discuss how we set put data, the background estimate, and the signal model together
    and make a claim as to the compatibility of the hypothesis with the data.
Largely, this means I need to finally understand how pyhf actually works and what the hell the limit framework is doing.

Finally, I need to reveal what our final results actually are, and what they mean.
Be ready to just put in filler results, since we probably won't have unblinded by the time I get here.
