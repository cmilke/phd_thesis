All the other professors at SMU?

Lacey and Michele

Matthew Feickert for friendship, guidance, and for fixing up this latex template.
As well, your own thesis\cite{matthew_feickert} is a beautiful example of what a thesis should be,
    and served as a constant template and metric by which I could measure my own progress.
Indeed, the ordering of this very section is templated off of yours.
