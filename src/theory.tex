%NOTE: according to Steve, you can (and SHOULD) use "I" in this chapter. Indeed, use "I" as well literally anywhere I specifically was responsible for something. Do NOT use royal "we". Only use "we" in the context of what "we" the HDBS 4b or dihiggs group have done as a group, and only if you have explicitly defined who "we" are.

\chapter{Theory}\label{chapter:experiment}

So what even do I need to talk about here?

Final goal = Higgs (final final goal should actually probably be di-higgs and a discussion of the relevence of this...)
    What: What is the Higgs?
    Why: Why do we care about it? It gives things mass and messes with the electroweak interaction
    When: In what contexts does the Higgs become relevant? The mass of (most) elementary particles and the weak force being weak
    Where: Where does the higgs fit into the SM? The "Higgs Mechanism"
    How: How does the higgs mechanism work?
