%NOTE: according to Steve, you can (and SHOULD) use "I" in this chapter. Indeed, use "I" as well literally anywhere I specifically was responsible for something. Do NOT use royal "we". Only use "we" in the context of what "we" the HDBS 4b or dihiggs group have done as a group, and only if you have explicitly defined who "we" are.

%So what even do I need to talk about here?
%
%Final goal = Higgs (final final goal should actually probably be di-higgs and a discussion of the relevence of this...)
%    What: What is the Higgs?
%    Why: Why do we care about it? It gives things mass and messes with the electroweak interaction
%    When: In what contexts does the Higgs become relevant? The mass of (most) elementary particles and the weak force being weak
%    Where: Where does the higgs fit into the SM? The "Higgs Mechanism"
%    How: How does the higgs mechanism work?

%    things I'm thinking of talking about but I'm not sure I actually need to discuss and also I'm not sure which section to put them in:
%
%        The poincare group transformations and their conserved quantities
%            
%            Translation: $\psi(x) \rightarrow e^{-\Delta x^{\mu} \partial_{\mu}} \psi(x)$
%
%            $U(1)$ Global: $\psi(x) \rightarrow e^{i \alpha} \psi(x)$
%
%            $U(1)$ Local: $\psi(x) \rightarrow e^{i \alpha(x)} \psi(x)$
%
%            $SU(2)$ Global:  $\psi_i(x) \rightarrow  U(\epsilon)_{ij} \psi_j$; $U_{ij} \equiv e^{i \epsilon_a (h_{a,ij} / 2)}$; $a=1,2,3$
%                $h_a$ are the pauli matrices
%                %- (cheng djvu pg 97 for details)
%
%            $SU(2)$ Local:  $\psi_i(x) \rightarrow  e^{i \epsilon_a(x) (h_{a,ij} / 2)} \psi_j$
%                %- (cheng djvu pg 238 for details)
%
%            $SU(3)$ Global:  $\psi_i(x) \rightarrow  U(\epsilon)_{ij} \psi_j$; $U_{ij} \equiv e^{i \epsilon_a (\lambda{a,ij} / 2)}$; $a=1,..., 8$
%                $\lambda_a$ are 3x3 traceless hermitian matrices
%            
%
%        what does a basic transformation look like. Show how you go from (1+da/dq) to e\^(dq*da/dq).
