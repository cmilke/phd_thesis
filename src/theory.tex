%So what even do I need to talk about here?
%
%Final goal = Higgs (final final goal should actually probably be di-higgs and a discussion of the relevence of this...)
%    What: What is the Higgs?
%    Why: Why do we care about it? It gives things mass and messes with the electroweak interaction
%    When: In what contexts does the Higgs become relevant? The mass of (most) elementary particles and the weak force being weak
%    Where: Where does the higgs fit into the SM? The "Higgs Mechanism"
%    How: How does the higgs mechanism work?
