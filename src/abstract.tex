A search for di-Higgs production via the Vector Boson Fusion mechanism
    decaying to 4 bottom quarks is performed using 
    126 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data from Run 2 of ATLAS at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.
The search was performed in the non-resonant regime,
    finding an upper bound on the production cross-section
    for the Standard Model \vbfproc of $150\mu$.
Constraints are placed on the both the \kvv and \kl Higgs self-coupling scale factors at 95\% confidence.
\kvv is constrained to an observed interval between $\kvv > 0.09$ and $\kvv < 1.98$,
    with expected constraints of $-0.03 < \kvv < 2.10$.
\kl is constrained with observed limits $-10.1 < \kl < 13.3$ and expected limits of $-11.6 < \kl < 14.9$.
No significant excess of events beyond the primarily multi-jet background is measured.
