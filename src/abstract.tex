A search for di-Higgs production via the Vector Boson Fusion mechanism
    decaying to 4 bottom quarks is performed using 
    126 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data from Run 2 of ATLAS at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.
The search was performed in the non-resonant regime,
    finding an upper bound on the production cross-section
    for the Standard Model \vbfproc of $150\mu$.
Constraints are placed on the \kvv and \kl Higgs self-coupling scale factors


Courtesy of the MC sample linear combination technique,
    \kl has been constrained to between -19.5 and 23.0 for all values of \kvv with a fixed \kv=1,
    and between -10.1 and 13.3 for $\kvv=\kv=1$.
Likewise, the extrema of \kvv have been established between -0.8 and 2.8
    if \kl is permitted to fluctuate beyond its SM value while \kv is fixed to 1.
The most noteworthy results of this thesis however, is that for $\kl=\kv=1$,
    the value of \kvv can be excluded to a confidence of 95\% outside the range of $0.1 < \kvv < 2.0$.
This marks the tightest published constraints to date, beating out the latest results from CMS
    of $-0.1 < \kvv < 2.2$\cite{cms_results}.
