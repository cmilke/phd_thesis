A search for di-Higgs production via the Vector Boson Fusion mechanism
    decaying to 4 bottom quarks is performed using 
    126 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data from Run 2 of ATLAS at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.
The search was performed in the non-resonant regime,
    finding an upper bound on the production cross-section
    for the Standard Model \vbfhhproc of about 200 times the Standard Model.
Constraints are placed on both the HHVV coupling
    (which determines the W/Z-higgs four-point interaction strength)
    and HHH Higgs self-coupling scale factors at 95\% confidence.
The HHVV coupling scaling factor (\kvv) is constrained
    to an observed interval between 0.09 and 1.98,
    with expected constraints of $-0.03 < \kvv < 2.10$.
The HHH Higgs self-coupling scale factor (\kl) is constrained
    with observed limits $-10.1 < \kl < 13.3$
    and expected limits of $-11.6 < \kl < 14.9$.
No significant excess of events beyond the primarily multi-jet background is measured.
